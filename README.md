# Personal Website for Ion Grumeza #

Ion Grumeza was born in Romania and lived there for twenty-nine years. He defected in 1972 in protest of the Communist regime, and, after six months in a refugee camp in Austria, he legally emigrated to the United States and became a citizen in 1978. His goal when he left Romania was to write books in American English—as soon as he learned the language. After many odd jobs as an immigrant, he made a living by managing a construction business, restoring twenty-eight churches throughout Connecticut and prominent buildings at Yale University. At the same time, he was a frequent guest on Radio Free Europe and Voice of America, speaking about eastern Europe and the end of Communism.

He immersed himself in the New York City libraries and the libraries at Yale University, absorbing knowledge in multiple fields of study. His articles on military events, particularly relating the World War II and the Eastern Front, have been published in military magazines and journals. He lectured at private and public schools on the collapse of communism.

Today Grumeza is an author, historian, educator, and philosopher. His books, articles, and philosophical website draw upon and reflect his life experience, as well as his scholarly studies. He was the Project Director of Science and Religion Articles of Distinction, a scholarly website about the dialogue between science and religion, managed by Templeton Foundation Press for the John Templeton Foundation. In 2006, he created and trademarked the word, “Effectology,” the name of his philosophical concept about the effects of accidents throughout history.

He was a featured speaker five times at the Macedo-Romanian Cultural Congress, held at Sacred Heart University in Fairfield, Connecticut. He currently leads courses for the Veritas society at Bellarmine University in Louisville, Kentucky.; in 2011, a history course, "Romania Through the Ages;" in 2012, a philosophy course,  "Effectology."

He holds a Bachelors Degree in Education and a Masters Degree in Education from the University of Bucharest, Romania. He completed courses in Humanistic Education at the University of Bridgeport, Connecticut, and courses in Research in Education at Hunter College, New York. He has a Ph.D. in Metaphysical Sciencse from the University of Metaphysical Sciences.

Ion Grumeza is a proud member of the Honorable Order of Kentucky Colonels. He is also a member of the Author’s Guild, the Filson Historical Society, and the English-Speaking Union. He resides in Kentucky and Florida.
